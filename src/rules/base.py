"""The rule abstraction: a measured quantity against a soft threshold.

Almost everything aiwa decides ("prompt now?", "is focus low?") is a quantity
against a threshold. A rule:

- `measure(context)`: the quantity (None = can't tell → never fires);
- `threshold`: the value where the chance of firing is 50%;
- `softness`: how gradual the change is, in the quantity's units: the chance is
  an S-curve (logistic), σ((value − threshold) / softness): ±1 softness from the
  threshold → 27% / 73%, ±2 → 12% / 88%. 0 = a hard step (fires from the threshold on);
- `direction`: +1 fires above the threshold, −1 below it;
- `range`: where the rule is active at all (bounds of the quantity; either may be
  None). Outside it, it never fires. A rule can also narrow this with `active()`,
  for conditions on the context rather than on the quantity;
- `decide(context)`: measure → chance → sample (a hard rule is simply 0 or 1).

Optionally `steps` replaces the curve with exact chances from given values on,
for rules whose numbers the user set exactly (e.g. the routine questions).
Rules combine with `AllOf` (chances multiplied: all must hold).
