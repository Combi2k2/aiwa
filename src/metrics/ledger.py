"""One entry per minute: the focus intensity and what you mostly did.

A minute [m, m + 1 min) gets:
- intensity: the main-window focus intensity at its end (None when mostly away)
- activity:  the label with the most time in that minute (deep, shallow,
             distraction, neutral, untracked, unclassified, away), or None
             when there's no data at all (e.g. ActivityWatch wasn't running)

"Deep" is not stored: it's intensity ≥ threshold, decided when reading, so a
new threshold also re-grades past days.
