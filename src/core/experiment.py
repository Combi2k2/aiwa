"""The 30-day test (Deep Work, rule 3: quit social media).

Pick one service (a website or app), stop using it for 30 days without telling
anyone, then answer two questions: would the last 30 days have been notably
better with it? Did anyone care that you weren't there? Two noes → quit it for
good. aiwa counts slips (a hard rule: the user's own commitment) and asks the
questions on day 30.
