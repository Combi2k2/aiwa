"""What a site's kind (core/kinds.py) means for the timeline.

- **Watching is not away.** No input while a video site or a call is in focus
  means watching or listening, not being away: the away time right after it
  becomes time on that site (with its category), up to `WATCH_LIMIT` (after that,
  e.g. a video left playing, it's away again).
- **Tools take their context.** A quick search or an AI-assistant question counts
  as part of what the user is working on: tool time takes the category of the
  work just before it. Switching to it still counts as switching.
