"""The AI helper for tasks (Google Gemini, via its REST API).

It only helps the user with *their own* tasks: suggesting steps when a task
needs breaking down, and a name for a new goal group. Suggestions are always
shown for the user to edit; it never adds tasks on its own.

Models are tried in order (the first may be busy); every call has a time limit,
and after all of them fail the AI is skipped for a while, so a service that's
down doesn't make the user wait on every request. On failure it returns None.
