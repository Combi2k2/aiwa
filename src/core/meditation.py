"""Productive meditation (Deep Work, rule 2): a walk spent thinking through one
well-defined problem.

After a good session aiwa sometimes suggests one (more likely the more deep work it had) (and the tray can start one any
time). The walk is a focus session on an offline "task" (the problem): being
away is the work, and it counts as deep minutes, up to its length (+ the usual
grace). Back at the computer, the user writes down what they figured out.
