"""The craftsman approach to tools (Deep Work, rule 3): keep a site or app only if it
clearly helps your core goals more than it costs.

It's about network tools and distractions, not work tools: sites and apps the
user counts as deep work are never asked about. The goal groups stand for the core goals. Whether a site/app serves a goal is learned
from data (core/association.py: its time share while that goal's tasks are active vs.
overall); a note taken there that became a task also counts as having helped. Its
week's time is "unserved" when it serves no goal. A rule
(time that served nothing, soft threshold) picks sites worth asking about; once per
weekly review the user is asked whether one of them substantially helps a goal. The
answer is remembered, and later reviews show how its time changed.
