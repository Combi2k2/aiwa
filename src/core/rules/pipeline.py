"""Decision pipelines: levels of atomic rules (the user's design).

A pipeline is a list of numbered levels, each a set of rules that vote. A level
approves when enough of its rules fire (by default a majority; a level can ask
for all of them, so its rules can't be outvoted). Level 1 votes first; only if it
approves does the next level vote, and so on. The action happens when every
level approves.

Rules read **signals**: named quantities computed from the current state
("focus_2m", "in_session", ...). `Signal` is the generic rule on one named signal
(threshold, softness, direction, range from core/rules/base.py), so a rule can be
plain data; later these can come from the user's config.
