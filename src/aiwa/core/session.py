"""Focus sessions: started and stopped by the user, never a fixed length.

Phases, by time since the start (the numbers are never shown to the user):

    building (0–25 min)  focus low for 1 min → poke, again every minute until focus is back
    free    (25–50 min)  no reminders to stop; focus low → ask "is this session done?",
                         and if the user keeps going, poke every minute while focus stays low
    wrap-up (50 min+)    "time to wrap up", repeated every 2 minutes until the user stops

In any phase: away for 5 minutes → alarm, repeated every minute until the user is back.

`FocusSession.step` turns (time, focus low?, away since) into one action; the app
shows it. Whether focus is "low" is decided outside (see `LowFocus`), so the rule
can later become personal (e.g. a quantile of the user's own history).
