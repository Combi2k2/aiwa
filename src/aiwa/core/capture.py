"""Capturing what's worth keeping from shallow work and distractions.

Outside focus sessions aiwa doesn't push for focus (the daily quota does that).
Instead, when the user is on something shallow (email, chat) or has been in
distraction (feeds, video) for a while, it asks whether there's anything worth
noting. A note that is a to-do becomes a task, linked to the tab or window it
came from; when the user hasn't gone back there for a while, aiwa asks whether
the task is finished (and offers to close the tab or window).
