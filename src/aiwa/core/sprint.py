"""Work like Roosevelt (Deep Work, rule 1): a short, intense burst on one task with a
deadline tighter than feels comfortable, counting down.

The deadline is the task's own estimate (a task typed in on the spot has no
estimate: then a few lengths to pick from). At the deadline: done, 5 more
minutes, or stop.
