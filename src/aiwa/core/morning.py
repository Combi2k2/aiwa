"""The morning start: from picking up the laptop to the first deep-work session.

1. The first activity of the day → show today's work and ask how long the morning
   routine takes (or "start now" / "heading out today").
2. The routine gets that time plus a buffer: clamp(20% of it, 5, 20) minutes.
3. Back at the computer early (after having stepped away) → "Finished your routine?"
   - finished → "start working?": yes → session; no → wait for the deadline
   - "not yet" → back to the routine, the deadline 1 minute later
4. Deadline reached without a session → the alarm rings until a session starts
   (or the user is heading out).
Starting a session at any point ends the morning.
