"""The shutdown ritual (Deep Work, rule 1): a clear end to the workday.

At the end of the workday aiwa walks the user through closing it: today's notes
(each becomes a task or stays a note), a wrap-up in their own words (anything
still open becomes a task, so it can be let go), a look at tomorrow, then
"shutdown complete". After that, work questions (capture) stop for the day.

When to offer it: two rules (core/rule.py) that must both hold, sampled every
few minutes:
- the time of day, a soft threshold at the shutdown time (18:00 → 50%; 16:00 1%,
  17:00 10%, 17:30 25%, 18:30 75%, 19:00 90%), active from 3 hours before it;
- low focus, a soft threshold below the 5-min focus score of 0.3 (unfocused or
  idle → ~100%), active only below 0.6: never while the user is focused.
