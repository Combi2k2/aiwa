"""The weekly review (4DX #4, a cadence of accountability).

Once a week, in the shutdown ritual of the week's last workday (or the next
shutdown, if that one was missed), the user sees how the week went (deep work
per day against the daily goal, per goal group with its priority, the chain,
start-time consistency) and answers one question: what will you change next
week? Their answer is shown again at the next review.
