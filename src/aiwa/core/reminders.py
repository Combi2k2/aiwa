"""Routine reminders from the user's own typical times (meals, sport, walks, ...).

From the absences the user labelled (core/routines.py), each activity gets its
usual times of day: the peaks of the (smoothed) distribution of its start times,
each with enough days behind it. A meal can have several (breakfast, lunch,
dinner).

Reminders are a rule (core/rule.py), sampled every 15 minutes while nothing that
looks like it has happened yet today: the quantity is the share of past days on
which it had already started by this time of day; threshold 0.5 (even odds when
half the days had started), soft (0.2 → 18%, 0.8 → 82%); never before the
earliest past start.
