"""Offline work in a focus session: being away is the work itself.

When the session's current task is marked offline (reading on paper, working by
hand, thinking it through on a walk), leaving the computer doesn't ring the away
alarm or end the session; the time away counts as deep work. Away much longer
than the task needs (its estimate + a grace period) → only the estimate is
credited, and the normal away rules take over from there.
