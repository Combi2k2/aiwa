"""The shallow-work budget (Deep Work, rule 4): how much of the day goes to shallow work.

A rule (core/rule.py): the quantity is the shallow share of today's time at the
computer; the threshold is the limit (50% chance of a prompt there), soft around
it. Active only after an hour at the computer (too early to judge before). The
chance is per check, checked every 30 minutes.
