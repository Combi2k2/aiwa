"""Which windows contribute to which goal, learned from data (the user's design).

Over time aiwa sees pairs (T, W): T = the goal group of the active task (the
session's group), or "open" when no task is active; W = the window in focus (the
site's domain or the app). A window whose share of time is clearly higher while a
goal's task is active than overall contributes to that goal.

- Pairs count by minutes; pairs with an active task weigh fully, "open" ones less
  (most of the time no task is active, and that time says little).
- lift(T, W) = P(W | T) / P(W), from the weighted minutes.
- A rule (core/rule.py) on the lift: threshold 1.5 (softness 0.3), active only with
  enough minutes of W during T. It classifies (chance ≥ 50% → contributes), so the
  result is stable rather than sampled.
