"""The task backlog: the user's incoming work, grouped by goal.

Tasks keep coming in (with a deadline and the user's own estimate) and the list
grows; nothing is "planned for a day". aiwa checks each task is atomic (specific,
and doable in one 50-minute session; otherwise the user breaks it down) and, for
each focus session, suggests one goal group to work on so the user doesn't switch
between goals. Group choice = urgency (remaining work ÷ time to the nearest
deadline) × importance (the group's priority).
