"""Depth: how deep the work in a window was.

    depth = Σ weight(category) × mode × time / Σ time      (neutral time left out of both sums)

Deep counts 1, shallow partly, distraction and unclassified 0 (see params.py).
Mode: creating (lots of keys and clicks) counts fully, consuming (reading,
watching) a bit less: creating > consuming good content > social media.
Neutral items (music player, settings, file manager) don't count for or
against you. None when the window has only neutral time.
